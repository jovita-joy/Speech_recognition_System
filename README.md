# üó£Ô∏è Speech-to-Text Transcription using Python and Google Speech Recognition

This project provides a simple and effective way to transcribe short audio clips into text using Python and the `SpeechRecognition` library. It uses Google's free speech-to-text API to perform the transcription.

## üìå Features

- Transcribes `.wav` audio files to text.
- Handles common errors (e.g., unclear audio or request failures).
- Easy-to-understand and beginner-friendly.
- No need for complex machine learning models or training.

1. Clone or Download the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text-transcriber.git
cd speech-to-text-transcriber

 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

python -m venv stt-env
stt-env\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
source stt-env/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux

3. Install Dependencies

pip install SpeechRecognition

4.Run the script

 Notes
Internet connection is required since this uses the Google Web Speech API.

Ensure the input file is in .wav format and is clearly spoken for best results.
